# Declaration of Purpose

_Development-Like Operations(DevLikeOps) is a project intending to bring the benefits of DevOps into the worlds of other specialties._

## Problem
>Manual labor became untennable for jobs requiring repetative actions that could have been done automatically.

## Solution 
>Computers were originally intended to make our lives easier. Yaaay, all our problems are over. It’s the post-scarcity society, and your robots now do all the work for you.

## New Problem
>Yeah okay that worked for a minute. Then the invention of the mouse, and it all went downhill from there. Today, you’re spending only 20% of your work time being productive. You’re using more technology and getting less work done than ever before.

## Real Solution
>Automation. The reason that w
Development Operations(DevOps)  as we like to call it, refers to the processes by which a bunch
of unstable code monkies are herded in a productive fashion. It’s an answer to the chaos of distanced cooperation. 
attempting to work on the same complex set of documents, at the same time. Our solution
is in automation, and the idea of Continuous Integration(CI). This particular Ops repository is here
to serve as a template for new Ops packages, and also the repository of those that already exist,
If you adapt this to another workflow other than what we already have, we ask that you 
Contribute it back, as described in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.markdown).
